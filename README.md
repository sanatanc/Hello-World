# Hello-World
My first repository training
This is the beginning. I am just here to know the fundamentals of github. 
I want to make the best use of this amazing tool that we have. I intend to make positive and useful contributions. 

My time constraints allow me to work upto 4 hours a day on programming. I really really want to join the microverse course, but I am not 100% sure how I will manage it. 
Lambda has a similar style. They need time commitmment.
